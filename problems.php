		<h1>Statement of Problems</h1>
		<p>As the owner of the subject property has died, it is uncertain given the documents available on the Property Online system whether they died testate or intestate. The current ownership of the lot is indeterminate. Given the the number of stuctures present within the boundaries of the lot, as well as the number of potential heirs (the owner had several children, most of whom are still living), it is likely a potentially issue.</p>
