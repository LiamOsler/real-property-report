		<p>The main subject property is identified by the PID number 00495390 (Lot 72) and other 'child' properties are located around the 1100 block of Downey Road. Child properties (as they exist today) are identified by PID numbers 40536211 (Lot 72-A), 40536229 (Lot 72-B) and 40650780 (Lot 72-X-Y).
		
		<p>Pursuant to the passage of the Land Titles Clarification Act (LTCA). <i>R.S., c. 250, s. 1.</i><sup><a href ="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> members of the community of North Preston are following the legal process of obtaining land titles for lands granted by the crown in the 18th and 19th centuries. A number of community members have been successful in obtaining titles.</p>
		<p>In the past the Provincial Government has provided the services of legal council and land surveyors to help facilitate the process of obtaining land titles, but this aid has ceased over the past few years. This project examines the chain of title of one property granted proper title in accordance with the LTCA.</p>
		<p>Despite efforts by local community groups<sup><a href ="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>, volunteers and the Provincial Government, many members of the community still remain without proper title to the lands they or their forbearers have occupied. Members of the North Preston community have become wary of the land grant process.<sup><a href ="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><sup><a href ="#ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><sup><a href ="#ref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
