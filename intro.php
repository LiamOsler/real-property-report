		<p>Pursuant to the passage of the Land Titles Clarification Act (LTCA). <i>R.S., c. 250, s. 1.</i><sup><a href ="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> members of the community of North Preston are following the legal process of obtaining land titles for lands granted by the crown in the 18th and 19th centuries. A number of community members have been successful in obtaining titles.</p>
		<p>In the past the Provincial Government has provided the services of legal council and land surveyors to help facilitate the process of obtaining land titles, but this aid has ceased over the past few years. This project examines the chain of title of one property granted proper title in accordance with the LTCA.</p>
